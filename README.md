# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To develop a fully interactive and visually structured Workout Library Page that displays different workout categories, suggested workouts, and filter options, providing users with an organized and personalized workout browsing experience.

## Algorithm:
1. Start
Begin the process of generating and displaying the Workout Library page.

2. Load User Information
Retrieve the logged-in user’s name and profile details.
Display a personalized greeting essage such as “Welcome back, Lisa!”.

3. Create Workout Category Blocks
Define all the workout categories to be displayed:
Cardio – Boost endurance
Strength – Build muscle and power
Yoga – Improve flexibility and balance
HIIT – Quick intense bursts
Yoga Stretch – Flexibility & balance

Assign each category:
A unique icon
A bright gradient background color
A short descriptive subtitle
Arrange these categories in a neat grid layout.

4. Generate Suggested Workouts Section
Fetch or determine the top recommended workouts for the user.
For each suggested workout, display:
Workout name (e.g., Quick Cardio)
Duration (e.g., 13 min)
A clickable arrow icon to start/open the workout
Display this section on the right side of the page for quick access.

5. Add Filtering & Browsing Options
Provide filtering options such as:
Filter by Duration (short, medium, long workouts)
Filter by Intensity (low, medium, high)
Include a Browse Workouts button to allow users to view all available sessions.

6. Design and Render the Page Layout
Use a smooth blue-to-white gradient background for a clean fitness aesthetic.
Add rounded cards, drop shadows, icons, and spacing to improve readability and appearance.
Ensure the layout matches the main dashboard style for visual consistency.

7. Display the Final Workout Library Interface
Render all components—categories, suggested workouts, filters, and buttons—into a final polished UI for the user.

8. End
The Workout Library page is successfully generated and ready for user interaction.
